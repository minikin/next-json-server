# Json Server

## Deploy to Heroku

1. [Create your database](https://github.com/minikin/next-json-server/blob/master/db.json)

2. Create an account on [https://heroku.com](https://heroku.com)

3. Install the Heroku CLI on your computer: [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

4. Connect the Heroku CLI to your account by writing the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions on the command line:

```bash
heroku login
```

5. Then create a remote heroku project, kinda like creating a git repository on GitHub. This will create a project on Heroku with a random name. If you want to name your app you have to supply your own name like `heroku create project-name`:

```bash
heroku create my-cool-project
```

6. Push your app to **Heroku** (you will see a wall of code)

```bash
git push heroku master
```

7. Visit your newly create app by opening it via heroku:

```bash
heroku open
```

8. For debugging if something went wrong:

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

9. Restart app

```bash
heroku restart -a next-json-server
```

10. Add heroku remote

```sh
heroku git:remote -a thawing-inlet-61413
```

## How it works

Heroku will look for a startup-script, this is by default `npm start` so make sure you have that in your `package.json` (assuming your script is called `server.js`):

```json
 "scripts": {
    "start" : "node server.js"
 }
```

You also have to make changes to the port, you can't hardcode a dev-port. But you can reference herokus port. So the code will have the following:

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;
```
